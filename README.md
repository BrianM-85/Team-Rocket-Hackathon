# Team-Rocket-Hackathon - Project Triathlon - A Bulma Theme

## What this is

This project was created for MintBean's JavaScript Olympics Hackathon that ran for 72 hours starting on Friday 8/28/20. The challenge was to create a front-end-only KanBan board. LocalStorage is used to persist user data across sessions.

## How to use it

`npm start` OR `yarn start` will run the server. 

You're already set up with `src/_overrides.scss` and `src/_variables.scss` files. You don't need to do anything more to start theming.
